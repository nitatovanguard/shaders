# Shaders

## Wave Shader

This shader is intended to simulate some types of waves, most notably the water waves seen at the top.

The two panels at the bottom show:
1. The movement of a single particle in the water waves
2. Plane waves

This is mathematical and based entirely on my own interpretation and understanding, having seen other similar simulations.
